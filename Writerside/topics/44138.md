The strangler fig architectural pattern helps with common problems in application evolution by gradually creating new functionality in an isolated area without risking regression to existing functionality. It utilizes a facade in front of multiple APIs to serve both old and new functionality without the consumer knowing. Considerations when using this pattern include single point of failure, maintaining commonalities with the existing application, and using it for sizable legacy applications.
