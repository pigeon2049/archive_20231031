Chinese technology giant Alibaba said on Tuesday it has updated its artificial intelligence (AI) model Tongyi Qianwen and released a suite of industry-specific AI models amid an intensifying AI race among tech companies. Alibaba’s cloud computing arm at its annual conference in Hangzhou said Tongyi Qianwen 2.0 has “hundreds of billions of” parameters - a benchmark used to measure AI model power - making it one of the world’s most powerful AI models by that metric. It also said it has launched eight AI models for the entertainment, finance, healthcare and legal industries.
