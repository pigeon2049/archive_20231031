Haiti's government has suspended all Nicaragua-bound flights leaving its capital, the Miami Herald reported on Monday, putting at least a temporary end to a key route for would-be Haitian migrants seeking to reach the U.S.

The Miami Herald cited a bulletin sent to the aviation community that was then shared with the newspaper as the source of the information.

The Haitian government has made no public announcement about the flights and Reuters was not able to independently confirm the suspension.

The Port-au-Prince to Managua flights began in August and have mostly been operated by charter carriers. In recent weeks, as many as 15 flights per day have ferried thousands of Haitians to Nicaragua. The Miami Herald said an independent tally found more than 31,400 Haitians had taken the flights from August to October.
