Bootstrap aggregation, also known as bagging, is an ensemble technique that aims to improve model performance and stability by combining predictions from multiple subsets of the original dataset. By using bagging, the performance of the classifier can be enhanced, as observed in the article where the accuracy increased from 82% to 95.5% when using the Bagging Classifier.
