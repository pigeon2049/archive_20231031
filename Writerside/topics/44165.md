Apple acknowledges that threat notifications sent to Indian opposition leaders may have been false alarms. They are investigating the issue and working on improving their threat detection system.  
Apple has not provided additional details about the threat notifications or the investigation, but experts speculate that a software glitch in their threat detection system might have caused the false alarms.
