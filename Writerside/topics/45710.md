The multinomial distribution in R is a probability distribution that describes the probability of obtaining a specific number of counts for different outcomes, when each outcome has a fixed probability of occurring. R provides functions like rmultinom() to simulate random samples and dmultinom() to calculate the probability of specific outcomes.
