Pakistan set a Nov. 1 deadline for all foreigners without legal documents, including more than a million [Afghans](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/afghans-return-taliban-rule-pakistan-moves-expel-17-million-2023-10-31/), to leave the country or face forcible expulsion.

Here are key facts about Islamabad's plan to deport hundreds of thousands back to its western neighbour Afghanistan:

\- Pakistan [announced](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-orders-all-illegal-immigrants-leave-after-suicide-bombings-2023-10-03/) the Wednesday deadline on Oct. 3, giving more than a million people about four weeks to move.

\- The sudden expulsion threat came after [suicide bombings](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/blast-southwest-pakistan-kills-13-more-than-50-injured-police-2023-09-29/) this year that the government said involved Afghans, though without providing evidence. Islamabad has also blamed them for smuggling and other militant attacks as well as petty crimes.

\- Islamabad says Afghan nationals were found to be involved in attacks against government and the army, including 14 of this year's 24 suicide bombings.

\- Pakistan is home to more than 4 million Afghan migrants and refugees, about 1.7 million of them [undocumented](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-urged-identify-protect-thousands-at-risk-afghan-deportees-sources-2023-10-31/), according to Islamabad, although many have lived in Pakistan for their entire lives.

\- About 600,000 Afghans have crossed into Pakistan since the Taliban took over in 2021, joining a large number present since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and the ensuing civil wars.

\- More than 60,000 Afghans [returned to Afghanistan](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/afghan-refugees-not-involved-pakistans-security-problems-taliban-2023-10-04/) from Pakistan between Sept. 23 and Oct. 22, ahead of the deadline, with thousands more expected to have been on the move last week.

\- Islamabad says deportation will be [orderly](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistani-minister-defends-decision-expel-afghans-2023-10-06/), carried out [in phases](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-finalises-plan-extradite-illegal-immigrants-nov-1-deadline-nears-2023-10-26/) and start with those who have criminal records. Authorities have vowed raids in areas suspected of housing "undocumented foreigners" after Wednesday.

\- Authorities have set up "holding centres" to process deportees before they return to Afghanistan. Reuters could not determine how long they might be detained in the centres.
