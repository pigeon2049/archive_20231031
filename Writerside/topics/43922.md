**A gunman who barricaded himself in a Japan post office for several hours with hostages has been arrested, local media report.**

Two women were taken captive by the man in the city of Warabi on Tuesday afternoon local time.

One was later released, while the second was freed after police rushed in and detained the suspect, public broadcaster NHK reported.

Both the women are said to be unharmed. The motive for the attack is unclear.

The gunman, who is reportedly in his 80s, is thought to have also been involved in a shooting at the nearby Toda Chuo General Hospital earlier in the day.

Two people, identified as a doctor and an elderly patient, were wounded in the attack. Their injuries are not thought to be life-threatening.

Japanese media, citing unnamed police sources, reported that the hostage-taker in the post office, which is about 2.5km (1.5 miles) from the hospital, was also the suspect from the hospital shooting. He reportedly fled the hospital on a motorcycle.

Later, a young woman was seen walking out of the building and being escorted away by police.

Those in the surrounding buildings of the busy residential neighbourhood were told to stay put during the standoff. Buses were sent to a school nearby to take the children back to their homes.

Shootings are rare in Japan. The country has strict gun ownership rules, and allows civilians only to own hunting rifles and airguns.

Owners must undergo a strict exam and mental health tests.
