Roughly 4,000 residents in [Southern California](https://www.cnbc.com/id/10000551) have been ordered to evacuate their homes due to a [raging fire](https://www.cnbc.com/wildfires/) in the small town of Aguanga in Riverside County, which spread further overnight.

Dry brush ignited Monday afternoon, causing a fire that was initially just 14 acres and was classified as spreading at a "moderate rate," according to the Riverside County Fire Department. In the evening, it was reclassified as a "critical rate" spread and had grown to more than 1,200 acres. The cause of the fire is under investigation.

The flare-up, dubbed the Highland Fire, destroyed three structures and damaged six others. The fire department has yet to identify what kind of structures they are.

By Tuesday morning, the fire expanded to 2,200 acres. More than 300 firefighters have been assigned to respond to the uncontained blaze. A care center is open at a [local high school](https://www.tvusd.k12.ca.us/gohs) for evacuated residents. An [animal shelter](https://rcdas.org/san-jacinto-valley-animal-campus-clinic) is open for those who want to drop off at-risk animals.

An additional 500 homes have been put on evacuation warning, which is not a mandate but asks residents to consider clearing the area. The fire department released a [searchable map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/4/viewer?mid=1AENSa0LPACfsuCEN9r9UZ04nrf39fHY&amp;ll=33.480006713425084%2C-116.95820268146598&amp;z=12) to locate the evacuated areas. Three roads in the region have also been closed.

Dry winds and low humidity have exacerbated the spread.

The National Weather Service has issued an air quality alert to surrounding neighborhoods due to the windblown dust and smoke of the wildfire.

As California blazes go, the Highland Fire is fairly standard. Over the [past five years](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/CALIFORNIA-WILDFIRES/gdpzyjxmovw/), the state experienced some of the [largest wildfires](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/13/climate-change-has-fueled-larger-wildfires-in-california-scientists.html) in its history, which have respectively burned hundreds of thousands, sometimes over one million, acres at a time.
