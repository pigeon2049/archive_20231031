You can now register .ing domains as part of an early access program. Some aren’t cheap: th.ing, for example, will cost you $38,999.99 per year from GoDaddy.

Google Registry is launching a new and really fun top-level domain: .ing. I am guessing you are already think.ing about some of the domains you might end up buy.ing.

You can now register .ing domains as part of Google’s early access period, though you’ll have to pay “an additional one-time fee,” Google’s Christina Yeh [wrote in a blog post](https://blog.google/products/registry/introducing-the-ing-top-level-domain/). That fee will go down daily through December 5th. At 16:00 UTC (noon ET) on that date, .ing domains will officially be publicly available.

A few of us at _The Verge_ have had some fun plugging different words into GoDaddy’s domain search to see what .ing domains are up for grabs. Some common words with -ing endings are _really_ expensive; think.ing and buy.ing cost $38,999.99 and $129,999.99, respectively, per year to register. But I’ve found a few good ones that are pretty affordable — good luck on the hunt!

Google Registry is also working on a .meme top-level domain, according to [a Google Registry post from August](https://www.registry.google/announcements/launch-details-for-ing-and-meme/). Currently, .meme is in a limited registration period, per a schedule on that post. Early access to .meme is set to open up on November 28th, and the domain will be available for anyone to register beginning December 5th.
