Becoming an iOS developer offers a high salary and the opportunity to work on interesting projects at top companies. It requires proficiency in the Swift programming language, logical thinking, problem-solving skills, and an understanding of software engineering principles. Learning iOS development takes time and effort, and the process can be accelerated by focusing on Swift programming and SwiftUI. While a formal degree in computer science is not always necessary, knowledge of fundamental computer science concepts can be highly beneficial. A Mac computer running the latest version of Xcode is essential for iOS development, while owning an iOS device is optional.
