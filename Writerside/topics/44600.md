Inflation across the euro zone dropped to a two-year low of 2.9% in October, according to preliminary data released Tuesday, down from 4.3% the previous month and below a consensus estimate of 3.1% from a Reuters poll of economists.

Core inflation — which excludes volatile food and energy prices — dropped to 4.2% year-on-year in October from 4.5% in September.

European Union statistics agency Eurostat also revealed that the euro zone economy contracted by 0.1% in the third quarter, according to flash estimates, below consensus estimates for GDP to be unchanged from the previous quarter.

The 20-country common currency bloc has been grappling with high inflation for the past 18 months, with the consumer price index peaking at 10.6% in October 2022.

The [European Central Bank](https://www.cnbc.com/european-central-bank/) responded with a run of 10 consecutive interest rate hikes that took its key rate to a record high of 4%, before [opting to pause last week](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/26/european-central-bank-holds-interest-rates-steady-after-10-consecutive-hikes.html) despite upside risks to energy costs as a result of the unfolding Israel-Hamas war.

The ECB expects the euro zone economy to grow by just 0.7% this year, by 1% in 2024 and 1.5% in 2025.

Europe's largest economy, Germany, [recorded a 0.1% quarterly fall in GDP](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Press/2023/10/PE23_420_811.html) for the third quarter, slightly better than the 0.3% decline forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. The economy shrank 0.8% on a price-adjusted basis from the same period last year.
