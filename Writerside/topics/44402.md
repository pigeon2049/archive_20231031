Abstract:

Recently, Verisign released the .com/.net data for 2023, reporting a 5.4% year-on-year increase in quarterly revenue to $3.76 billion. Net profit stood at $1.88 billion, higher than the $1.69 billion from a year ago.

Recently, Witzyuters has reduced the growth expectations of 2023.Com/.NET to potential negative growth. The reason is that (this is not the first time) China demand is sluggish.

The registered management agency predicts that by the end of this year, its domain name base will increase up to 0.4%or reduce 0.4%. In contrast, the forecast growth rate at the beginning of the year was 0%to 2.25%.

There are many reasons for this situation. One of the reasons is that on September 1, 2023, Witssed Settles increased the price of the domain name of the .com domain name, an increase of 7%.

CEO Jim Bidzos told analysts on Thursday: "China's downturn is still the main factor of dragging the overall domain name basis."

The company's regulatory filing documents in the third quarter show that China's revenue has dropped from $ 26.8 million to $ 22 million throughout the year. This is one of the only sectors in the four geographical reporting departments.

As of the third quarter, the .COM/.NET domain name managed by Witzyuters was 173.9 million, a decrease of 0.1%year -on -year, and a decrease of 500,000 domain names in this quarter.

Although the growth of DUM (domain names in the hosting) may decline, the rise in prices can make up for and maintain the growth of Weizhi's dollar.

The company announced that revenue in 2023 increased by 5.4%year -on -year to $ 376 million. The net profit was US $ 188 million, which was higher than $ 169 million a year ago.

In the third quarter of 2023, Weizesin handled 9.9 million.COM and .NET's new domain name registration, which was the same as the third quarter of last year.

The final .com and .NET renewal rates in the second quarter of 2023 were 73.4%, while the same quarter in 2022 was 73.8%. The renewal rate will not be completely measured after 45 days after the quarter.
